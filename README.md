# Stock Price Forecasting Using Hybrid Deep Learning Models

This capstone project explores stock price prediction using hybrid models such as **CNN-LSTM**, **Transformer-LSTM**, and **XGBoost-LSTM**. It builds on the paper [Predicting Stock Market Time-Series Data using CNN-LSTM Neural Network Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14378) and aims to improve prediction accuracy across multiple datasets.
